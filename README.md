# Hi 👋, I'm Jerry

### Full-Stack Developer | Product Creator

I'm a software engineer with a strong passion for software development, always looking for ways to build scalable and market-driven products. Over the years, I've independently developed product prototypes for startups, taking ideas from high-level abstraction to practical implementation.

I enjoy working through the entire development process—from **User Story Mapping** to **TDD, Dependency Injection, and Clean Architecture**. My focus is on translating business needs into solid technical solutions, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and ensuring that the software we ship is **accurate, robust, and maintainable**.

## 🎮 I Love Minecraft!
I've been running Minecraft servers for years, and I'm still actively managing **CastleWars**, a competitive 5v5 PvP game. The project has evolved into a well-balanced, tournament-ready game, featuring advanced mechanics, statistics tracking, and live streaming capabilities. If you're into strategic PvP battles, come [check it out](https://www.youtube.com/live/cARFwuseIJw?feature=share&t=3322)! 🚀
